# Sentiment Detection from Images Using Deep Learning


Overview

This project detects emotions like happy, sad, or neutral from facial images using deep learning. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to analyze facial expressions and classify the sentiment automatically.

How It Works
Input: An image containing a face

Process: The image is preprocessed and passed through a trained CNN model

Output: Predicted sentiment label (e.g., Happy, Sad, Neutral)

Key Points

Uses CNN for feature extraction and classification

Handles image preprocessing and normalization

Provides easy-to-use interface for prediction

Requirements

Python 3.x

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

NumPy

Usage

Run the application script (app.py) to upload an image and get sentiment predictions.
